# Mission to Mars - Web Scraping with HTML/CSS

## Purpose
A junior data scientist with dreams of working at NASA wants to gather data about the mission to Mars from all over the web and display it in a central location. She needs help writing a script that gathers the information being searched for, ultimately building a web application that will scrape new data every time you tell it to by clicking a button.

The steps of this project are outlined below:
- Write a Python script that can nagivate webpages to collect the right information
- Use MongoDB to store the data
- Create the web application with Flask and then customize it with HTML and CSS
